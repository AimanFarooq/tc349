The MSU homepage is very well designed, it follows the University's style guide and is user friendly in that it is dynamic, it uses great responsive elements, it is easy and intuitive to find content, and the site is well coded with animated elements that aren't tacky.
First off the content is dynamic, from day to day the items on the site change to be as timely as possible. You can trust that the site will be up to date without having to search for time stamps on the content. The elements are responsive as they change when you interact with them, the best example of this is the menus which expand when you mouse over them and the sub nav bar elements that highlight when you mouse over them. The animated elements catch your attention without pushing things too far. They further the idea without trying to stand on their own as a piece of content to show off.
The ease of information access on the site is great because it isn't like some sites where there are ambiguous titles and search queries necessary to get where you want to go. From the initial page load at the top of the page despite the size of your screen you are likely to be able to immediately see and have access to the content or menus that you want. 
Overall I am a fan of the MSU website.
