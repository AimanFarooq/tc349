			<h2>Process & Findings</h2>
				<p>
					The process of card sorting for this study of the content on <a href="http://www.89xradio.com" title="89X Radio">89XRadio.com</a> consisted of three separate steps: content scraping, sorting, and interpreting findings. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When scraping content from 89X's website I separated out all of the items from each of the menus as well as the menu titles themselves. I felt that even some of the headings could be rearranged so this would be beneficial. When I sorted the cards myself I separated content into 11 categories or areas as opposed to the current website which uses over 15 areas, of which some are multiples. My intention was to simplify the current layout of the site which I feel can be overwhelming at times when trying to find content. I had 7 people sort cards and I found some areas of overlap which are noted in the table below. I think that generally these people created more categories and allowed things to be spaced out more. This is seen most in the administrative/business area. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When looking at the findings from the card sorting survey there were definitely some areas of consensus for certain groupings which agreed with my sorting. The limitation in this however is that this context is very specific and isolating the terms from the context with content that is "proprietary" to this radio station's listeners is not the best approach. To reapproach this and get more valuable results it would be useful to survey listeners of the station who had not used their website.
