Chartbeat has a very creative website, there are some things I like about it and some not so much. The areas of emphasis for the site are the aesthetic design and color choice, space utilization, content-flow, and responsiveness. 
The aesthetic design of the site is great, probably my favorite part of the whole site, it uses very friendly blues and whites for the overall main theme but highlights it with reds and greys for key areas or interactive elements. The designs of the elements are also very nice, they are simple vectored images with minor flair with how they are interconnected and some of them are animated. These flourishes make it seem far more interesting without overcomplicating.
The space utilization is something I think could use some work, to get all of the information it requires a lot of vertical scrolling. This is softened by the use of animations between sections.  The data could be more effectively displayed with multiple columns which would make more information visible without scrolling but maintain the section divisions. The content flow despite the inefficient space use is great because of the graphics and animations used to connect each area but these could easily be translated in to a more horizontal design. The responsiveness of the site is good as elements change with hovers and clicks for the most part, though there are some clickable elements that do not respond which can be a little confusing.
Overall the site is strong but it could be improved in a few ways.
