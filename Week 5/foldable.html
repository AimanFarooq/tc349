			<h2>Process & Findings</h2>
				<p>
					The process of card sorting for this study of the content on <a href="http://www.foldable.me" title="Foldable">Foldable.me</a> consisted of three separate steps: content scraping, sorting, and interpreting findings. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For the first step content scraping is used to determine which cards are going to be sorted, I scanned through the website and found all the different pieces of fragmented content. When I say "fragmented" I mean content that could in theory be separated and put on a different page (in a technical sense as opposed to a content flow sense). Elements that were inside interactive pieces like the foldable creator were not taken in to account because separating them would actually require breaking the website. After all the cards were determined the process of sorting began. Each participant sorted the cards by which they found to go together the best. This showed what people linked together in their minds.
				</p>
				<p>
					When looking at the findings there are moderately tight groupings which show that there was a general consensus on how the content goes together. The limitation of this study however is that there was a small sample size. I did find that people found that Social Media outlets and blogs went together in groupings and that any terms related to e-commerce like cart, gift certificates, and shipping all belong together. In a future card sorting excercise it would be beneficial to have a larger sample set to get a wider spread of groupings.
