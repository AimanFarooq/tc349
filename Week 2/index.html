<p>His experience includes being involved informally with a guerilla marketing campaign from Ubisoft Montreal his freshman year of high school. Social Media marketing is a major interest of mine. het's interesting to him to examine the ways that people interact with each other and with brands on the web through increasingly accessible mediums.</p>

<p>He has strong communication and leadership skills as demonstrated through his previous positions. Something of importance is that Aiman is technology obsessed. he spends most of his free time reading tech blogs. He is never more than a few hours out of the loop with the latest news. Any other free time he has he often spends on finding the best ways to use technology for hisself and groups he work with (mostly for himself though!). he's a strong supporter of Google's Android operating system. Tech is his passion.</p>

<h2>Critique</h2>
<p>I want to preface this by saying that I love the design of this site for many reasons. The site was definitely either created by a designer or they had a really great designer on staff. The main reasons I like it are Great graphics and interactive design.</p>
<p>The first reason I liked the site was for the graphics, they are well thought out and represent the products well. The are high res and look great and appealing for visually oriented people. The images look great on nice displays. The contrast between the main "pallette" or body of the site and the footer works really well and immediately communicates it's purpose to the viewer. The second reason I like the site is for the interactive design, it feels like it's alive and breathing and reacting to the user. This is the kind of site that people want to use and they will come back to if for nothing else than just for novelty.</p>
