My development environment consists of three different components; Notepad++, Google Chrome, and a native Git client.
The reason why I prefer to use Notepad++ over other text editing alternatives is because of my familiarity with it. I have used this application throughout all of my own web design for personal, educational, and professional experiences. The aspects that originally drew me to it were the line by line editing, syntax monitoring, and extensive plugin options. The plugins allow for things like inserting dummy (Lorem Ipsum) text automatically, or even a comparison editor which overlays two files on top of each other and highlights the changes for you so you can make adjustments. I also like the tabbed interface that it uses.
I use Google Chrome because it is my main browser and I use it across multiple devices. I use Chrome on my PCs, Android handsets, Android Tablets, and Chromebook. Google is currently bringing the Android version of Chrome up to speed with the desktop versions and including it as the standard browser for Android mobile devices going forward so it's a great browser to target when debugging.
I prefer a native git client because it makes my workflow much easier.
