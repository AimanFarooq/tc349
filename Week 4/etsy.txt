As a site designed for amateur and semi-professional creatives alike, Etsy is a site that should be expected to be well designed. I like the design of Etsy quite a bit, the key points that make the site's design great are great information flow, adaptability, color choice, responsive design, and dynamically loaded content. 
The information flow or architecture of the site is great because it immediately presents you with new content upon visiting the site, the sidebars also allow for quick navigation to niche interest areas, and the search bar is right at the top which allows you to jump to specific items. From the initial page load you are able to go to many areas of the site as well as view new content before you even have to scroll. The different sections on the homepage for new content are adaptable and can change with timely content without disrupting the familiar feel of the site. As you scroll down on the site more content will load, this is nice because it lowers the impact of loading on the initial rendering of the page which will make it feel more responsive initially.
The color choice is great because the UI elements are mostly muted which allows for the content to stand apart more easily. Colors jump out of the images of Valentines Day jewelry. The design is also responsive as you mouse over menus and content, there is a glow to assure you that links are actionable. When mousing over content there are even overlays that load which allow for quick actions like favoriting items.
Overall the design of Etsy is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
