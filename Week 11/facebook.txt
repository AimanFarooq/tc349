The Facebook mobile site is extremely functional but not very aesthetically pleasing. The key elements that influence the appeal of the Facebook mobile site are adaptiveness of the design, item interactivity or responsiveness, design, and visual response.
What is especially interesting about the Facebook mobile site is that it also has dedicated mobile apps for the major platforms though many people still choose to use the mobile web. The adaptiveness of the structure and layout is great as it still maintains the majority of the functionality of the full Facebook site in a more compact form factor. The only area where the functionality is really lost is in the more advanced management of pages for companies or groups. Moving forward from there the area where the mobile web lacks most in contrast with the app is that the elements do not properly react to touch with visual cues and therefore results in a frustrating experience. Users don't always immediately know if they are tapping on the correct areas because tap areas are not clearly defined with large padding values as you would see in a mobile app. On a mobile app you'd also see reactions from elements when in the "hover" state.
The Facebook mobile site is a great example of a complex site done well but there are definitely areas to be improved on. What I like best about it as opposed to the native Android app is that it doesn't run in the background and use location data. It will be interesting to see though how the new Facebook Home app compares to the mobile site.
