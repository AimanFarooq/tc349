I really like the design of United Pixel Workers, it has a nice color scheme, the elements have basic interactivity and responsiveness, content is well organized, and fuctionality is intuitive.
The color scheme works well on the web and is also well suited for modern displays both on PC monitors and mobile devices that tend to have higher color saturation. The color scheme will grab attention without being offensive. The responsiveness is nice as you mouse over elements they lightly jump to indicate that you can interact with them and also serve as a way to visually separate different content areas especially where one item is split in to multiple box elements.
The content is well organized and is easy to find under well labeled headers. The adaptability of the site is nice as you scroll through the content the cart follows the view allowing access without having to go back to the top of the page and allows for important information views at a glance. The only thing that I would like to see added there is maybe have some of the other header/navigation tool elements follow the view as well to allow for quicker navigation through different pages of the site.
Overall the design is great and I could see it adapting well to different form factors.
