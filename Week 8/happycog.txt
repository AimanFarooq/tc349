I like the design of Happy Cog very much as a result of it's color scheme, visual content, and dynamic layout. The one reason that I don't like it is the vertical stacking of content.
The color scheme is muted and inoffensive to the eye, nothing is aggressively jumping out at the viewer and allows for a more natural viewing of the content. The images that are used help to highlight the text content and make it very scannable. It's easy to pick out content at a glance when browsing the site. The combination of these two elements allow for users to pick out the most usable information without having to use intrusive styles of text that gain attention for the sake of gaining attention.
In terms of the layout I like that the navigation bar scrolls with the page, it allows for easy access to other parts of the site no matter what it is you're looking at. This aspect mostly forgives the fact that the content is very much vertically stacked. There is a lot of scrolling required to view all of the content. More often than not this can be a dealbreaker for me because the available content is not immediately obvious and can dissuade some users. The scrolling nav bar makes it more friendly when navigating this content though so it is only one small factor in the face of an overall very polished site.
