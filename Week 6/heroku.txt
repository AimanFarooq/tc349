Heroku.com has a very nice and muted design which is also functional. The aspects of the site that are noteworthy are the color scheme, use of images, and responsiveness.
The color scheme may be my favorite part of the site. The shades of blue and grey match each other very well and are nicely highlighted by white text and images. The lighter blue top region provides a nice visual break between the navigation and the content. Overall the colors put me at ease which is something that I like in a site. The images blend well in to the background that they are placed on and even exhibit some evidence of skeumorphic design by using shadows that help them to stand out from the page. The subtle design on the background also helps to make these things pop out.
Lastly the responsiveness of the site to interaction is subtle but effective. When mousing over the navigation tool the links brightened to white and the same is seen on the major content headings in the body of the page. When clicking on the image headers on the homepage the small pointer moves to underneath the indicated header and shows the new content. Near the bottom just above the footer the small blocks with images increase in satuation when highlighted, whereas before the mostly desaturated and slightly opaque images blended in to the background.

The reason I chose the two column layout that I did for my personal site was because it was the best suited for the content I had displayed. The content on my personal site was mostly text oriented and broken up in sequential paragraphs which would not have functioned well in the gallery format. The two column layout is also slightly similar to the design inspiration that I'm going with in trying to create a design that closely emulates (in appearance) the dark holo theme in Android. The two column approach looks somewhat similar to the android UI fragments.
