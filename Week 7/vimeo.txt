Despite it's huge popularity I am personally not a fan of Vimeo's design. The main reasons for this are there is too much content, menus are unintuitive and change after logging in, and it is very focused on vertical stacking of content.
There is far too much content when initially loading Vimeo, on a slow connection this would be very problematic. For this reason I would prefer to use a mobile app for the site so that there isn't as much overhead to load. The page is very busy with each section utilizing wildly different color schemes, it is actually painful to look at. It's also very text heavy for a website that is supposed to be based around video content. 
Menus are untuitive, the information architecture is poor with some navigation elements creating sub-menus and others showing a generic sub-menu. It was dizzying to try and navigate through the site. There are also far too many options within each page. The nav element should be expanded and resorted to allow users to more quickly reach their intended content.
I have a strong distaste for vertical stacking of content, I want to have the most immediate information visible the moment the page loads and I don't get that with vimeo, this is another aspect which would make it intimidating to many new users.
In an area dominated by YouTube I think Vimeo should rethink their design to be more easily navigable.
