			<h2>I am one of the Team Leaders for the <a href="http://www.ASUS.com" title="ASUS">ASUS</a> Student Rep Program</h2>
			
			<p>I began as a rep for <a href="http://campuslife.asus.com" title="ASUS CampusLife">ASUS CampusLife</a> in Fall 2011 after an interesting process of trying to get an interview. I finally managed to get an interview after harassing the hiring manager until I could finally get his attention. I literally almost showed up at the door of his office before he finally gave me a phone interview where I finally got the chance to prove that I would be an invaluable asset to the program. I have been a part of some significant projects as part of the program and I was asked to head up on of the teams for the program starting in the Summer of 2012. Here are a few of the things I have done while in this position:
				<ul>
					<li>Hosted events on the MSU Campus to create ASUS Brand Awareness</li>
					<li>Paid for my own trip to CES 2012 to show that student created video and blog content could be beneficial to the brand.</li>
					<li>Wrote for the student blog. My content can be found <a href="http://campuslife.asus.com/index/author/aiman-farooq/">here</a></li>
					<li>Began as head of the Blogger Team in Summer 2012</li>
					<li>Was invited (paid) to CES 2013 to continue creating content like I had at CES 2012</li>
				</ul>
			Below you can find some of the content I created for ASUS at CES this year.

				After I graduate this summer I intend to move out to Fremont, CA to continue working for ASUS.
