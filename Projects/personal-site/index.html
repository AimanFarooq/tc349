	<h2>I am a Media and Information Technology Major here at Michigan State University</h2>
	
	<p>I started here at Michigan State in Fall 2010 and I've been on an accelerated track (see: took way more classes than was wise at times) to graduating and doing something with my degree. For a brief time last year I considered doing a double major with Journalism but decided against it. I have had a a moderate amount of experience with Web Design and HTML starting back in Middle School. Below is a list of some of my experience:
		<ul>
			<li>Intro to HTML in the Nintendo NSider Forums - 2004</li>
			<li>Served as Webmaster for <a title="Midwest Muslim Yourh Council" href="http://www.mmyc.org">MMYC</a> - 2008-2010</li>
			<li>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CSE 101 Web Track - 2011-2012</li>
			<li>Took CAS 204 - 2012</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		I plan to graduate this Summer (2013) and then pursue a career in either Radio or Social Media Marketing. My ideal career would be in Community Management for Google.
