			<p>After taking JRN 492 this summer with <a title="Karl Gude" href="http://www.twitter.com/KarlGude">Karl Gude</a> this past summer I was offered a position with Media Sandbox. Starting shortly before the beginning of the fall semester last year I took over the Director of Social Media Marketing and I have been the main driving force behind Sandbox's social media outlets, though I generally try to keep it a "ghost-written" medium to maintain the image of Sandbox. Since I've taken over I have more than doubled the audience on Facebook and greatly increased our audience on Twitter. The level of interaction and outreach has been greatly improved as well. I originally signed on for a trial basis but it has since become my main job here at the University. Below are some things I have done in this position:
				<ul>
					<li>Created brand awareness and a sense of community for The Media Sandbox</li>
					<li>Coordinate daily posts on both <a title="@MediaSandboxMSU" href="http://www.twitter.com/MediaSandbox">Twitter</a> and <a title="Media Sandbox on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/MediaSandbox">Facebook</a></li>
					<li>Seek outreach opportunities</li>
					<li>Facilitated initial contact and helped to plan out a guest speaking engagement with a Community Manager at Google</li>
					<li>Worked with a team from CAS on a regular basis to create and implement strategies for the college for outreach and recruitment</li>
				</ul>			
			</p>
			<p>
				As I have been managing the social media outlets for all this time I am always looking for new content which is a difficult job. Here you can see an example of content I've posted on the Sandbox pages.
